## 1. Preparing the VPS Environment  

### Step 1: Accessing the VPS  
Log in to your Hostinger VPS via SSH by replacing `your_vps_ip` with your VPS IP address:  
```bash  
ssh root@your_vps_ip  
```  

### Step 2: Update and Upgrade the System  
Keep your VPS up to date by running the following commands:  
```bash  
sudo apt update  
sudo apt upgrade -y  
```  

### Step 3: Install Node.js and npm  
If Node.js and npm are not installed, run the following commands:  
```bash  
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo bash -  
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs  
```  

### Step 4: Install Git  
Git is essential for cloning project repositories:  
```bash  
sudo apt install -y git  
```

## 2. Setting Up the MongoDB Database  

### Step 1: Install MongoDB  
Install necessary dependencies:  
```bash  
sudo apt-get install gnupg curl  
```  
Add the MongoDB GPG key and create a MongoDB list file:  
```bash  
curl -fsSL https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-7.0.asc | sudo gpg -o /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-7.0.gpg --dearmor  
echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-7.0.gpg ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu jammy/mongodb-org/7.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-7.0.list  
```  
Update the package lists and install MongoDB:  
```bash  
sudo apt-get update  
sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org  
```  

### Step 2: Start and Enable MongoDB Service  
Run the following commands to start and enable MongoDB:  
```bash  
sudo systemctl daemon-reload  
sudo systemctl start mongod  
sudo systemctl enable mongod  
```  
Check the service status:  
```bash  
sudo systemctl status mongod  
```  

The MongoDB URI for your project will be:  
```bash  
mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017  
```

### Optional: Configure MongoDB Authentication and Secure Access  

If additional security is needed, follow these steps:  

#### Step 1: Allow MongoDB Through the Firewall  
Enable the firewall:  
```bash  
sudo ufw enable  
```  
Check firewall status and open necessary ports:  
```bash  
sudo ufw status  
sudo ufw allow 27017  
sudo ufw allow 'OpenSSH'  
```  
Restart MongoDB:  
```bash  
sudo service mongod restart  
```  

#### Step 2: Create a Superuser for MongoDB  
Connect to the MongoDB shell:  
```bash  
mongosh  
```  
Switch to the admin database:  
```bash  
use admin  
```  
Create a superuser with all privileges:  
```bash  
db.createUser({ user: "username-here", pwd: passwordPrompt(), roles: ["root"] })  
```  
Exit the shell:  
```bash  
.exit  
```  

Edit the MongoDB configuration to enable authorization:  
```bash  
sudo nano /etc/mongod.conf  
```  
Uncomment and modify the security section:  
```yaml  
security:  
  authorization: enabled  
```  
Restart MongoDB:  
```bash  
sudo service mongod restart  
```  

To access the shell as a superuser:  
```bash  
mongosh --port 27017 --authenticationDatabase "admin" -u "username-here" -p "password-here"  
```

## 3. Deploying the Express and Node.js Backend  

### Step 1: Clone Your Backend Repository  
Create a directory and clone your backend repository:  
```bash  
mkdir -p /var/www  
cd /var/www  
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git  
cd your-repo/backend  
```  

### Step 2: Install Dependencies  
Install the required packages:  
```bash  
npm install  
```  

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables  
Create and configure your `.env` file with necessary values like database URI and port:  
```bash  
nano .env  
```  

### Step 4: Start the Backend Using PM2  
Install PM2 globally and start the backend server:  
```bash  
npm install -g pm2  
pm2 start server.js --name project-backend  
```  
Set PM2 to run on system startup:  
```bash  
pm2 startup  
pm2 save  
```  

### Step 5: Configure the Firewall  
If the firewall is enabled, allow necessary ports:  
```bash  
sudo ufw allow 'OpenSSH'  
sudo ufw allow 4000  # Change if using a different port  
```

Sure! Here’s a more detailed version of the **Configuring Nginx as a Reverse Proxy** section, with explanations, commands, and configurations for both frontend apps and backend services:

---

## **5. Configuring Nginx as a Reverse Proxy**  

Nginx will act as a reverse proxy to route incoming client requests to both your frontend and backend applications. This setup improves security, simplifies routing, and enhances performance by managing all requests through a single entry point.

### **Step 1: Install and Configure Nginx**  

1. **Install Nginx:**  
   Use the following command to install Nginx on your server:  
   ```bash  
   sudo apt update  
   sudo apt install -y nginx  
   ```  

2. **Allow Nginx Through the Firewall:**  
   If you are using `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall), allow Nginx traffic by running:  
   ```bash  
   sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'  
   ```  
   This command opens the necessary HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) ports.

3. **Check Nginx Status:**  
   To ensure that Nginx is installed and running:  
   ```bash  
   sudo systemctl status nginx  
   ```  
   If it is not running, start Nginx with:  
   ```bash  
   sudo systemctl start nginx  
   ```  

---

### **Step 2: Configure Nginx for Frontend Apps**  

Nginx needs to be configured to serve your frontend applications. You will create a separate configuration file for each domain and configure Nginx to serve static files (such as React or Vue builds) or route to your Next.js app dynamically.

#### **2.1: Configure Nginx for Static Frontend (React/Vue)**  

1. **Create a Configuration File:**  
   Create a new Nginx configuration file for your frontend app’s domain:  
   ```bash  
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/yourdomain1.com.conf  
   ```  

2. **Add the following Configuration:**  
   This configuration assumes that your static frontend files are located in `/var/www/your-repo/frontend/dist`:  
   ```nginx  
   server {  
       listen 80;  
       server_name yourdomain1.com www.yourdomain1.com;  

       location / {  
           root /var/www/your-repo/frontend/dist;  
           index index.html;  
           try_files $uri /index.html;  
       }  
   }  
   ```  

   **Explanation of Directives:**  
   - `listen 80`: Specifies that this server block will listen on port 80 (HTTP).  
   - `server_name yourdomain1.com www.yourdomain1.com`: Defines the domains that will be routed by this server block. Replace `yourdomain1.com` with your actual domain.  
   - `location /`: This block defines how to handle requests to `/`.  
     - `root /var/www/your-repo/frontend/dist`: Points to the folder where your frontend app's static files are stored.  
     - `try_files $uri /index.html`: Ensures that React or Vue’s client-side routing works by serving `index.html` for unknown paths.  

3. **Enable the Configuration:**  
   Once the configuration is added, enable it by creating a symbolic link to the `sites-enabled` directory:  
   ```bash  
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/yourdomain1.com.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/  
   ```  

4. **Check for Configuration Errors:**  
   Before restarting Nginx, check for any syntax errors:  
   ```bash  
   sudo nginx -t  
   ```  

5. **Restart Nginx to Apply Changes:**  
   Finally, restart Nginx to load the new configuration:  
   ```bash  
   sudo systemctl restart nginx  
   ```  

---

### **Step 3: Configure Nginx for Next.js App**  

For a Next.js app, Nginx can serve the dynamic content and handle server-side rendering (SSR).  

1. **Create and Edit a Configuration File:**  
   ```bash  
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/nextjs-app.com.conf  
   ```  

2. **Add the Configuration:**  
   Assuming your Next.js app is running on port 3000, use this configuration:  
   ```nginx  
   server {  
       listen 80;  
       server_name nextjs-app.com www.nextjs-app.com;  

       location / {  
           proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;  
           proxy_http_version 1.1;  
           proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;  
           proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';  
           proxy_set_header Host $host;  
           proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;  
       }  
   }  
   ```  

   **Explanation of Directives:**  
   - `proxy_pass http://localhost:3000`: Routes incoming requests to the Next.js app running on port 3000.  
   - `proxy_set_header`: Passes specific headers to the backend, ensuring compatibility with WebSocket connections and SSR.  
   - `proxy_cache_bypass`: Prevents caching issues during development or when updating the Next.js app.  

3. **Enable the Configuration and Restart Nginx:**  
   - Create a symbolic link to `sites-enabled`:  
     ```bash  
     sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/nextjs-app.com.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/  
     ```  
   - Restart Nginx:  
     ```bash  
     sudo systemctl restart nginx  
     ```  

---

### **Step 4: Configure Nginx for Backend API (Express/Node.js)**  

If you have a backend API running on another port (e.g., port 4000), Nginx can also reverse proxy requests to it.

1. **Create and Edit a Configuration File:**  
   ```bash  
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/api-backend.com.conf  
   ```  

2. **Add the Configuration:**  
   ```nginx  
   server {  
       listen 80;  
       server_name api-backend.com www.api-backend.com;  

       location / {  
           proxy_pass http://localhost:4000;  
           proxy_http_version 1.1;  
           proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;  
           proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';  
           proxy_set_header Host $host;  
           proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;  
       }  
   }  
   ```  

   This setup will forward all incoming API requests to the backend service running on port 4000.

3. **Enable the Configuration and Restart Nginx:**  
   Follow the same steps to enable and restart Nginx:  
   ```bash  
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/api-backend.com.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/  
   sudo systemctl restart nginx  
   ```  

---

### **Step 5: Configure SSL (Optional but Recommended)**  

If your app is live, it’s essential to secure your server with SSL. This can be done using **Certbot**:  
```bash  
sudo apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx  
sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain1.com -d www.yourdomain1.com  
```  

This will automatically generate and apply SSL certificates. You can then verify HTTPS is working by visiting:  
`https://yourdomain1.com`.

---

### **Final Notes:**  
- To manage multiple domains, repeat the process with separate configuration files for each domain.  
- If you make changes, always check the configuration with `sudo nginx -t` and restart Nginx.  
- You can monitor logs with:  
  ```bash  
  sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log  
  sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log  
  ```  

---

This configuration sets up Nginx as a robust reverse proxy for your frontend, Next.js SSR app, and backend API, enabling seamless routing and improved security.  

This guide ensures a smooth and secure deployment of your MERN stack project on Hostinger VPS.
